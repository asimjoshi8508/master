System Design Concepts

- Database Fundamentals
	- Indexes - Hash Indexes, B+ Trees, LSM Trees with SS Tables
	- Transactions - ACID BASE
	- Row vs Column Storage
- Data Serialization (Read again)
- Replication
	- Single Leader
 	- Synchronous vs Asynchronous
	- Multi Leader
		- Last Write Wins
		- Storing Siblings
		- Automatic Resolution
	- Leaderless
		- Replication Quorums - N Replicas, W write replicas, R read replicas -> N < W + R
- Sharding
	- Key Range
	- Range of Key Hash
	- Consistent Hashing
	- Local Secondary Indexes (Read again)
	- Global Secondary Indexes (Read again)
		- Two Phase Commit
		- Asynchronous GSI
	- SQL vs NoSQL

- Batch Processing
	- Frameworks (Map reduce vs Spark read)

- Stream Processing
	- Producers & Consumers
	- In-Memory Message Broker (In memory)
	- Log Based Message Broker (On disk)
	- Stateful Consumer Framework

- Other Storages
	- Search Indexes
	- Distributed File System
	- Graph Database
	- Object Store
	- Time Series Database
	- GeoSpatial Indexes
	- Coordination Services

- Caching
	- Write Through
	- Write Around
	- Write Back
	- CDN

- Load Balancing
	- Fault Tolerance
		- Active-Active
		- Active-Passive
