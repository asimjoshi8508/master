Batch processing is a way of handling large volumes of data all at once (in “batches”) rather than in real-time.
You collect data over a period (e.g., a day or an hour), and then you process it in one go—like running a big overnight job.

Example Analogy:
Think of it like doing laundry. You collect a bunch of dirty clothes (data), and once you have enough, you wash them all together in one batch.

Why Use Batch Processing?
Efficiency for Large Datasets
Collect data and process it in bulk instead of handling each record individually.

Scheduled or Periodic Jobs
Many businesses run daily, weekly, or monthly processes (e.g., payroll, sales reports).

Simpler than Real-Time
Easier to handle data in chunks if you don’t need instant results.

Real-World Applications
Payroll Systems
Companies gather all employee hours and process salaries once per month.

End-of-Day Bank Processing
Banks process all transactions at the end of the day to reconcile accounts.

Data Warehousing & Reporting
E-commerce sites gather orders throughout the day, then generate sales reports at night.

Big Data Analytics
Logs or sensor data are collected all day and analyzed later for trends (e.g., daily or weekly).

Batch Processing Frameworks
1. Apache Hadoop (MapReduce)
Key Idea: Break big data sets into chunks, process them in parallel across many nodes.
Map Phase: Transform or filter data in parallel.
Reduce Phase: Aggregate or combine results.
Great For: Traditional large-scale batch jobs (e.g., analyzing logs or transactions).
Real-World Example:
Yahoo! used Hadoop to process massive web data for analytics.
Twitter historically used Hadoop to generate usage reports and insights overnight.

2. Apache Spark (Batch via Spark Core)
Key Idea: Uses Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDDs) to process large data sets in memory, faster than MapReduce.
Batch + Streaming: Spark can do both batch (Spark Core) and near real-time (Spark Streaming).
Great For: Iterative algorithms (machine learning), fast analytics on big data sets.
Real-World Example:
Netflix uses Spark to run recommendation algorithms on large user watch data.
Uber uses Spark for data analytics on rides and fares.

3. Apache Flink (Batch & Streaming)
Key Idea: Handles streaming as its core, but also does batch processing by treating batch data as a “bounded stream.”
Real-World Example:
Alibaba uses Flink to power analytics in its e-commerce platform.

4. Other Notable Mentions
AWS EMR (Elastic MapReduce): Managed Hadoop/Spark service on AWS.
Google Dataflow: Unified model for batch & streaming (uses Apache Beam).
Microsoft Azure Data Factory (or Databricks): For orchestrating batch jobs in the cloud.

How Batch Jobs Typically Run
Data Collection:
Gather data (e.g., logs, transactions) into files or tables over time.

Prepare or Cleanse Data:
Convert it into a consistent format, remove duplicates or errors.

Apply Computations:
Summaries, aggregations, transformations—e.g., total sales, user behavior patterns.

Store Results:
Save processed data in a data warehouse or produce reports/dashboards.

Schedule & Automate:
Often run overnight or periodically using cron jobs or a workflow orchestrator.

When to Choose Batch Processing
Data sets are huge and not time-critical (e.g., daily stats).
Cost-effective approach to run big jobs at off-peak hours.
Your use case can handle waiting minutes to hours for results (like monthly payroll or business reports).

Pros & Cons of Batch Processing
Pros:
High throughput for large data sets.
Cost-Effective: You can optimize resources by running at scheduled times.
Simplicity: Easier to implement when you don’t need real-time updates.

Cons:
Delay: Data isn’t processed immediately; you get results after the batch finishes.
No real-time insights: Not suitable if you need instant analytics or alerts.

Summary
Batch processing is about grouping data and processing it at once (like doing laundry).
Frameworks like Hadoop MapReduce, Spark, and Flink help handle massive data sets across many servers.
Common in finance, e-commerce, data warehousing, and big data analytics.
If your application can tolerate some delay and works best with periodic heavy-lift tasks, batch processing is the go-to solution.
