An object store (also called object storage) is a way of storing data as "objects", each containing the file’s data, some metadata, and a unique identifier.
Unlike traditional file systems with folders and hierarchical paths, object stores treat all data as objects in a flat (or global) address space.

Think of it like a giant online bucket where you drop files (objects).
You don’t worry about folders or drives; you just have objects with unique IDs and metadata that tells you what they are.

How Object Storage Works (Simple Terms)
Objects Instead of Files
Each piece of data is put into an object, which includes:
Data (payload): The file’s contents (like an image or document).
Metadata: Information about the file (e.g., creation time, content type).
Unique ID: Often called a key or object name (e.g., file-123.png).

Flat Namespace
There’s no concept of directories like in a traditional file system.
You just have a bucket (or container) with many objects in it.
You access an object by its unique key (e.g., my-bucket/shirt.png).

Scalability & Distribution
Behind the scenes, the system can split your data across many servers.
When you store an object, the system replicates it for durability (often across multiple data centers).

Easy to Access via APIs
Object stores typically expose a RESTful API—so you can upload, download, or list objects using standard HTTP methods.

Why Use Object Storage?
Massive Scalability
Designed to handle billions of objects (like photos, videos, logs).

Low Cost
Optimized for storing large amounts of unstructured data at affordable prices.

High Durability
Data is usually replicated multiple times across servers or regions.

Simple Access
You can upload or retrieve an object from anywhere with an internet connection and the right permissions.

Real-World Applications
Cloud Backups and Archives
Example: Amazon S3, Azure Blob Storage for storing backup files, snapshots, old data.
Why? Cheap to store large volumes of data for long periods, with easy retrieval.

Media Hosting and Streaming
Example: Video or image files served from object storage.
Companies store images, videos, audio on services like Amazon S3 or Google Cloud Storage, letting users access or stream them anywhere.

Data Lakes and Big Data
Example: Storing logs, sensor data as objects in a single “lake.”
Tools like AWS Lake Formation or Azure Data Lake let analytics services (e.g., Hive, Spark) query directly from object storage.

Web & Mobile App Content
Example: Uploading user profile pictures or documents.
App developers store user-generated content (photos, attachments) in object storage, then serve them via secure URLs.

IoT Sensor Data
Example: Billions of sensor readings from connected devices are pushed into an object store.
The data remains there for machine learning or analytics later.

Content Delivery Networks (CDN)
Example: Cloudflare, Akamai, or AWS CloudFront fetching from your object bucket.
Speeds up global delivery of static files.

Popular Object Storage Services
Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)
One of the earliest and most used.
Offers different storage classes (e.g., Standard, Glacier) for cost optimization.

Microsoft Azure Blob Storage
Similar functionality for storing blobs (Binary Large OBjects).
Integrates well with other Azure services.

Google Cloud Storage
Offers multiple classes (Standard, Nearline, Coldline) to handle different access patterns.

MinIO, Ceph, Swift (Open Source)
For self-hosted object storage solutions on-premises or in your own data center.

Benefits & Trade-Offs
Benefits
Infinite Scalability (practically).
Resilience (automatic replication, versioning).
Low Cost for large datasets.
Simple Access via APIs.

Drawbacks
No Direct File System Semantics: Hard to do, for example, partial file edits.
Higher Latency than local disk for small, frequent writes.
Eventually Consistent in some implementations (though many provide strong consistency nowadays).

Summary
An object store is a flat repository where each file (object) has a unique identifier, metadata, and content, often accessed via a REST API.
It’s excellent for storing huge amounts of unstructured data (images, videos, backups, logs) with high durability and low cost.
Whether you’re saving user photos, enterprise backups, or building a data lake, object storage is a go-to solution for modern, scalable data needs.
