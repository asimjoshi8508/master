A time series database is designed to store and manage data points that are attached to timestamps.
Rather than just storing rows of information (like a traditional relational database), a TSDB focuses on sequences of values over time—making it easy and efficient to record, retrieve, and analyze data that changes or accumulates as time progresses.

How Time Series Databases Store Data
Timestamp-Focused
Each record is tagged with a time (e.g., 2025-10-11T10:45:00Z).
Data is typically stored in chronological order.

Series Organization
Data is grouped into “series” (e.g., sensor readings from a particular sensor or metric).
You might see terms like measurement, metric, or field referring to a specific value (e.g., temperature, CPU usage).

Compression & Efficient Writes
Many TSDBs use compression and specialized data structures optimized for appending (writing new data points quickly).
They can handle massive write loads from thousands or millions of data sources.

Metadata / Tags
Time series data often has tags or labels that describe the data source.
Example: For a temperature sensor, you might have location=“kitchen” and sensorID=“abc123”.

Retention Policies
Time series data can grow huge quickly. TSDBs often let you define retention policies (e.g., keep raw data for 7 days, then aggregate it monthly).

Why Use a Time Series Database?
Optimized for Time-Based Queries
Queries like “What was the average CPU usage in the last hour?” or “What’s the temperature trend over the past week?” are fast, because the data is chronologically organized.

High Ingest Rate
IoT devices, sensors, and logs can produce millions of data points per second. TSDBs are built to handle continuous data streams efficiently.

Specialized Functions
Many TSDBs have built-in functions for aggregations, windowing (group by time windows), and downsampling (storing aggregated data over time).

Scalability
You can often distribute time series data across multiple nodes, scaling to very large data sets.

Real-World Applications
IoT Sensor Monitoring
Example: A smart factory has temperature, vibration, and humidity sensors sending readings every second. A TSDB stores these readings for real-time dashboards and alerts.

DevOps / System Monitoring
Example: Tools like Prometheus or InfluxDB collect CPU usage, memory, network stats from servers.
You query the TSDB to see spikes or trends in resource usage.

Financial Market Data
Example: Stock prices change every millisecond. Storing each price tick in a TSDB allows quick charting of historical trends or real-time analytics.

Smart Energy Grids
Example: Electricity usage measurements from thousands of homes, recorded every minute or hour. Utilities analyze load patterns and forecast demand.

Application Logging (Event Data)
Example: Log events with timestamps from a web application, stored in a TSDB to easily find spikes in error rates or user traffic.

Scientific Research
Example: Environmental sensors measuring air quality, or astronomical observations across time. Researchers query large volumes of time-tagged data.

Popular Time Series Databases
InfluxDB
Focused on high write throughput, real-time queries, with its own query language (Flux/InfluxQL).
Offers downsampling and retention policies out of the box.

Prometheus
Used in DevOps for monitoring containers, servers, etc.
Pull-based model, frequently scrapes metrics from endpoints and stores them.

TimescaleDB
Built on PostgreSQL; adds time series superpowers (compression, partitioning).
Great for mixing time series with relational queries.

Graphite
An older but still-used TSDB for system metrics, often used alongside statsd.

OpenTSDB
Built on top of HBase for distributed storage of large-scale time series data.

Advantages & Drawbacks
Advantages
Fast time-based queries (optimized indexes).
Handles massive data ingestion (common in IoT/monitoring).
Built-in time-related functions (aggregations, rollups).

Drawbacks
Specialized solution (not always best for general-purpose data).
Some TSDBs may require complex scaling setups.
Need to define retention/archiving strategies to avoid huge storage costs.

Summary
A time series database is tailor-made for storing, querying, and analyzing data points that have timestamps—like sensor readings, server metrics, or financial ticks.
They excel at handling high-volume streams of data arriving in chronological order, offering powerful time-based queries and efficient storage strategies (compression, retention policies).
Real-world use cases include IoT monitoring, DevOps metrics, finance, and any scenario where you track changes over time.
