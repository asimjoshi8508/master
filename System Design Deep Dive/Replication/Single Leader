Single-leader replication (often called master-slave or primary-replica replication) is a database replication strategy where one node (the leader or master) handles all write operations, 
and then copies (replicates) those changes to one or more follower nodes. Those follower nodes primarily handle read requests.

It’s like having a head chef (leader) who decides the menu and cooks the main dishes, 
then assistant chefs (followers) replicate the same dishes by following the head chef’s instructions.

How It Works (Step by Step)
All writes go to the leader:
If you insert or update data, you send that request to the leader.

Leader updates its data:
The leader applies the change to its local database.

Leader sends changes to followers:
Once the leader commits the change, it sends a replication log to the followers.

Followers update their copies:
The followers apply the changes to stay in sync with the leader.

Reads can go to either leader or followers (depending on setup):
In many setups, reads are directed to followers to reduce load on the leader.
Some critical reads might still go to the leader to ensure the latest data.

Why Use Single-Leader Replication?
Simplicity:
Easy to understand; only one node processes writes, so no conflicting updates.
Scalability (Reads):
Many followers can handle read traffic, spreading the load.
Ease of Maintenance:
Straightforward to add or remove follower nodes without complex coordination.

Drawback:
Single point of failure for writes—if the leader goes down, you might need manual or semi-automatic failover to a new leader.

Real-World Applications
1. MySQL Master-Slave Setup
E-commerce Websites:
All orders (write operations) go to the master MySQL server.
Followers replicate the data and handle catalog browsing or analytics queries.

2. PostgreSQL Primary-Replica
Banking Systems:
The primary node handles deposits, withdrawals (writes), ensuring each transaction is recorded.
Replicas handle reporting or balance queries, reducing read load on the primary.

3. MongoDB Replica Sets (Single Primary)
Content Management Systems:
The primary node handles new articles or updates.
Secondary nodes serve many read requests from site visitors.

4. Redis Master-Replica
Caching & Session Storage:
A master node handles all session updates (e.g., user login tokens).
Replica nodes handle read traffic from thousands of web servers.

5. AWS RDS Read Replicas
Cloud Databases:
You can create read replicas of your main RDS instance in AWS to offload read queries.
The main instance remains the single leader for all writes.

Single-Leader Replication vs. Other Methods
Replication Method	Description	Good For
Single-Leader (Master-Slave)	One leader for writes, multiple read replicas	Easy read scaling, simple setups
Multi-Leader	Multiple nodes can accept writes (sync needed)	Geographically distributed writes, but more complex
Leaderless (e.g., Dynamo)	Any node can accept writes, consensus used for reads/writes	Very fault-tolerant, used in NoSQL (Cassandra, DynamoDB)

Why It’s Common
Straightforward to implement.
Most traditional RDBMS (relational databases) like MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and SQL Server can be configured in a single-leader replication mode.
Perfect for scenarios where you have lots of reads but fewer writes.

Key Takeaways
Single-Leader Replication:
One node handles all writes.
Followers replicate data and handle reads.

Use Cases:
High read traffic: e-commerce product browsing, news articles, banking queries.
Systems needing a simpler replication model without complex conflict resolution.

Limitations:
Leader node can become a bottleneck for writes.
Manual failover needed if the leader fails.

In short: Single-leader replication is popular and easy to manage, but it requires careful handling of the leader’s role to avoid downtime or performance bottlenecks.
